# React Libraries
Congrats! You've just gone through the React documentation and are now ready to move past the simple To-Do example. Since you'll be working on exciting rich single page applications, you should consider the following toolkit that will solve recurring issues and keep your focus on your product.

- [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized): Virtualized lists and tables. 
- [react-virtualized-select](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized-select): A virtualized select dropdown.
- [react-linkify](https://github.com/tasti/react-linkify/): parse links, emails... in text and turns them into clickable links.
- [react-debounce-input](https://github.com/nkbt/react-debounce-input): It's a good idea to debounce onChange for text fields because you almost never need to waste cycles reacting to every user key stroke.
- [react-document-title](https://github.com/gaearon/react-document-title): A declarative way to specify document.title in a single-page app.
- [react-dotdotdot](https://github.com/CezaryDanielNowak/React-dotdotdot): Cross Browser multiline text ellipsis to help manage dynamic content.
- [numeral](https://github.com/adamwdraper/Numeral-js): A great library for formatting and manipulating numbers.
- [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios): Promise based HTTP client for the browser.
- [immutable](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/): Immutable persistent data collections for Javascript which increase efficiency and simplicity. 

*Notes:*
- A list is Virtualized (windowed) when only visible rows are rendered.
- Make sure you download React Developper Tools. You can use it to inspect and interact with your components in the browser.
